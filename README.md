# UHC
The UHC (abbreviation for Ultra HardCore) is a popular Minecraft survival minigame that can be played alone or with a team.
This a mod that implements it for Fabric using the [Plasmid API](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/plasmid).

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/NucleoidMC/UHC/wiki) for instructions on how to personalize your UHC experience!  

This is a part of an attempt to create an open source Fabric-based minigames server.
