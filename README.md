# üçè UHC

UHC (abbreviation for Ultra HardCore) is a popular Minecraft survival minigame that can be played alone or with a team.
This mod includes:
* **UHC**, the classic UHC experience.
* **UHCRun**, a variant that tweaks the game in many ways to make it 2x faster.
* **DoubleRunner**, a variant that makes it even faster than UHCRun.

UHC is one of the minigames made for the [Nucleoid Project](https://nucleoid.xyz/), an effort to build an open source ecosystem for server-side Minecraft minigames.
You may even be interested in playing some of them over on our testing Minecraft server at `nucleoid.xyz`!
You can also find us on our [Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) if you have any troubles or queries, or would like to get involved.
