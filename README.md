# UHC

UHC (abbreviation for Ultra HardCore) is a popular Minecraft survival minigame that can be played alone or with a team.
This mod also includes UHCRun, a variant of UHC 

Build Rush is one of the minigames made for the [Nucleoid Project](https://nucleoid.xyz/), an effort to build an open source ecosystem for server-side Minecraft minigames.
You may even be interested in playing some of them over on our testing Minecraft server at `nucleoid.xyz`!
You can also find us on our [Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord) if you have any troubles or queries, or would like to get involved.
